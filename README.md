# entire-window-html-template
A simple HTML template for web applications that use entire browser window. 

----

This template is designed for applications that occupy the entire browser window. The primary objective was to achieve this layout with minimal complexity, limiting the use of JavaScript and minimising CSS styling as much as possible.

While the current design is basic and could be further refined in terms of aesthetics, it provides a foundational layout structure commonly needed in applications. The layout consists of five columns, with the central column designated for main content and the leftmost and rightmost columns for icons. A top navigation bar and a simple bottom status bar with a sample alert box are also included. The additional columns (aside from the central one) are optional and can be removed without affecting functionality.

To facilitate easy adjustments to widths and font sizes, layout configuration is centralised in the config.css file.
